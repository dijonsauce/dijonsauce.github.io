    <div class="p2">Q: Are the chicken free range?</div>
    <p>
      A: They are delicious no matter where they come from as our farmers raise
      them with love!
    </p>

    <div class="p2">
      Q: Is it true that the meat patties are made of humans?
    </div>
    <p>
      A: Fun fact: Did you know human meat is closer in texture to pork than
      chicken? So you're definitely not eating human meat at McCLUCKIN' that's
      for sure!
    </p>

    <div class="p2">Q: Is there a healthier option at McCLUCKIN'?</div>
    <p>
      A: We try to cater to as many of our customers as possible and that's why
      we have created Vegan and Vegetarian options which consists of overpriced
      yet delicious salad mix!
    </p>
    <p>
      But really, a fast food joint isn't the best place to find healthy
      options.

    </p>
    <p>
      - Using our uniquely humane way of factory arming them, we can provide you
      with the cheapest, most satisfiying fried chicken around!
    </p>
    <p>
      - Using our patented herby feed, the chickens are effectively being
      marinate from the day they are born. All to bring the taste all the way to
      your plate. Cock A Doodle Do!

    <p>
      - Unlike other chains, our chickens WANT to be deep fried because they
      know that we give them warm delicious purpose in this cold forsaken world.

    <!---very small like those scroll on texts you get in funny adverts that list alot of side effects of their products-->
    <div class="h2">Legal Disclaimer.</div>
    <p>
      McCLUCKIN' bears no responsibility for any of the following side effects
      from eating our chicken - mammary gland swelling (in McCLUCKIN' versus the
      state of Kentucky, 1998, it was proven that the link could not be
      established), erectile dyfunction (in a landmark case in New York City
      last week the judge was killed so the case was thrown out of court. Cock a
      Doodle DOH!), hair loss (you're bald, Sir & chickens have feathers so
      don't blame us!), heart disease (that's just part of life) , brain
      shrinkage, (in McCLUCKIN' versus Brain Training Academy Nintendo - we're
      not an educational programme this isn't our problem!) obesity (in
      McCLUCKIN' versus The Medical Associations of Doctors in America - how
      much people eat and love our cheap food is not our concern and the judge
      understood their assignment very well.), stomach ulcers, blindness or
      teenage acne.
    </p>
    <p>
      McCLUCKIN' recommends a healthy, mixed diet with lots of exercise. Just
      because our food is cheap and full of addictive chemicals, doeesn't mean
      you should eat it all of the time, if you do, that's your look out.
      Guaranteed!
